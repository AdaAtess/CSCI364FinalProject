This project is designed to generate 3D models of buildings based on user preferences. The aim is to help generate earthquake-safe building models in the future based on user preferences.

How to run code:
-Each OpenSCAD file contains one or more modules that can be run separately as functions to model building features
-Run "python3 geneticAlgo.py" in the terminal and then the program will ask the user a few questions about 
building size, features, and preferred frequencies of features. Then press exit to generate a building.
-You can then use bigProgram to model the output from the genetic algorithm. bigProgram in OpenSCAD takes as arguments the x, y, and z dimensions and then the chromosome list 
generated in Python.
Example code to run in bigProgram file: bigProgram(4,4,2, [list from the genetic algorithm Python file])
