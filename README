How to run code:
-Each OpenSCAD file contains one or more modules that can be run separately as functions to model building features
-Run "python3 geneticAlgo.py" in the terminal and then the program will ask the user a few questions about 
building size, features, and preferred frequencies of features. Then press exit to generate a building.
-You can then use bigProgram to model the output from the genetic algorithm
